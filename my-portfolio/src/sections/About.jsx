            I’m an Information Systems student at Universitas Multimedia Nusantara (expected 2027, GPA 3.51/4.00). I enjoy building responsive web applications and turning ideas into clean UI with strong user experience. I also have hands-on exposure to data analysis and machine learning basics through multiple prediction and modeling projects.
